# Token Management and Administration API

The **Token Requestor APIs** provide a secure and flexible infrastructure for payment card tokenization and the management of associated resources.
Their main goal is to ensure **secure payment processing** while offering administrators **centralized control** over consumers, merchants, sites, and credentials.

These APIs are designed to integrate with payment gateways, service providers, and merchants, providing tools to:
- Reduce risks associated with handling sensitive data.
- Enhance the user experience in tokenization processes.
- Maintain a scalable ecosystem aligned with payment brand standards (Visa, Mastercard).
