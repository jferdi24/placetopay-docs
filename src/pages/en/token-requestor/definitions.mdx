# Key Definitions

## Consumer - _**Consumers**_

The main entity that represents a payment gateway or an external client that owns one or more merchants registered in the system.
This consumer can be a company or an individual responsible for managing access credentials and the merchants subscribed to Token Requestor.

---

## Merchant - _**Merchant**_

Represents a specific merchant linked to a consumer. It is the unit that will be charged for token generation and management.
For a merchant to manage tokens, it must be associated with an active **Merchant Brand**.

---

## Sites - _**Sites**_

Represent the points of sale or websites associated with merchants that use the platform to accept payments via tokens.
A merchant can have one or multiple sites where consumers perform their tokenization processes.

---

## Credentials - _**Credentials**_

These are the credentials used to authenticate and authorize both consumers and merchants when interacting with the Token Requestor platform.
They enable secure access to the platform’s APIs.

---

## Merchant Brand - _**Merchant Brand**_

Represents the merchant before the brand **VISA** or **MASTERCARD**.
A merchant may have multiple entries in Merchant Brand, one for each brand it accepts.

This entity originates from the onboarding process with the brand, where the merchant is registered with the card networks for token generation.
If the merchant is registered under multiple consumers, there will still be only one merchant record with the brands.

---

## Onboarding - _**Onboarding**_

The process by which a merchant registers with a card network (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) to accept payments via tokens.
During onboarding, the system validates the merchant’s information and its integration with the payment networks.

This entity stores all onboarding attempts with the brands, along with their status and logs.

---

## Cryptograms - _**Cryptograms**_

The token is a generated value that replaces sensitive payment card data.
The token is used to process payments securely, preventing the storage or transmission of real card numbers.

---

## Role - _**Role**_

Represents the different levels of access and permissions that can be assigned to users in the administration system.
Roles define what actions a user can perform within the platform.

---

## Role Permission - _**RolePermission**_

Defines which actions a role can perform within the system.
These actions are assigned to roles and define access control based on the type of operation a user can perform (read, write, delete, etc.).

---

## Permissions - _**Permissions**_

Represent the specific actions that can be performed within the Token Requestor platform.
These actions include access to API endpoints and the management of resources such as tokens, merchants, and onboarding.
