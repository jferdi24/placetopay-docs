# Key Definitions

## Payment Orders - ( Invoice ) - _**Invoice**_

This is the digital document issued by the billing system. Each payment order has a **unique ID** automatically assigned, which is used in all operations such as blocking, releasing, deleting, or querying.

A payment order can be in different statuses (`ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `EXPIRED`, etc.) and contains debtor information, amounts, taxes, and key dates.

## Payment Order Block - _**Invoice Hold**_

This is the process by which a payment order is **marked as blocked**.
When blocked, the payment order shows a **“processing”** status in the admin panel and **cannot be edited or deleted**.
The block is reversed through the **payment order release** operation.

---

## Payment Order Release - _**Invoice Release**_

This is the opposite action of blocking. A released payment order becomes active again and is available for editing or deletion operations, as long as it has not been paid.

---

## Payment Order Deletion - _**Invoice Remove**_

This process **permanently deletes** an individual payment order from the system.
The operation is **irreversible**, and although the payment order is deleted, the service response returns the information it had before deletion as evidence of the operation.

---

## Bulk Deletion - _**Invoice Flush**_

This process deletes **all payment orders** from a site that are **not paid or blocked**.
The action is irreversible and is intended for large-scale cleanup processes within the system.

---

## Payment Order Dates - _**Invoice Dates**_

A payment order includes three key dates for its management:

- **createdAt** → The date when it was created.
- **expirationDate** → The due date.
- **finalDate** → The last date available for settlement or use.

---

## Debtor - _**Debtor**_

An entity or individual associated with a payment order, representing the person responsible for payment.
It includes basic information such as document number, type, first name, and last name.
