# Key Definitions

## Invoice - _**Factura**_

It is the digital document issued by the invoices system.
Each invoice has a **unique id** automatically assigned, which is used in all operations such as hold, release, removal, or query.

An invoice can have different statuses (`ACTIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `EXPIRED`, etc.) and contains debtor information, amounts, taxes, and key dates.

---

## Invoice Hold - _**Bloqueo de Factura**_

This is the process by which an invoice is **marked as blocked**.
When blocked, the invoice shows a payment status of **“in process”** in the administrative panel and **cannot be edited or deleted**.
The hold can be reverted through the **invoice release** operation.

---

## Invoice Release - _**Liberación de Factura**_

The opposite action of hold.
A released invoice becomes active again and available for editing or removal, as long as it has not been paid.

---

## Invoice Remove - _**Eliminación de Factura**_

Process that **permanently deletes** a single invoice from the system.
This operation is **irreversible**, and although the invoice is deleted, the service response returns the data it contained before deletion as evidence of the operation.

---

## Invoice Flush - _**Eliminación Masiva**_

Process that deletes **all expired invoices** from a site.
An invoice is considered expired when its `expirationDate` is earlier than the current date and time.
Invoices that are **paid or blocked are not deleted**.
This action is irreversible and intended for large-scale system cleanup processes.

---

## Invoice Dates - _**Fechas de Factura**_

An invoice includes three key dates for its management:

- **createdAt** → Date when the invoice was created.
- **expirationDate** → Invoice due date.
- **finalDate** → Final date for settlement or use of the invoice.

---

## Debtor - _**Deudor**_

Entity associated with an invoice, representing the party responsible for payment.
Includes basic information such as document number, document type, first name, and surname.
