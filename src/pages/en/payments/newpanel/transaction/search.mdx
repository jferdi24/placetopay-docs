# Transactions module

The transactions module allows users to view and manage operations within the system securely and efficiently. Through this functionality, you can check the status of transactions and obtain detailed information.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## Transaction query.

The Transaction Query allows users to view the history of operations performed in the system. Advanced filters, such as date, transaction type, and status, facilitate the search and analysis of specific records.

To start the query, you must enter the Transactions option. 

![querytrx](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/querytrx.webp) 

The Transactions, Recurring Transactions, and Transaction Statistics options should be displayed. 
There is a filter option and a table that allows you to view transactions with the following fields: date, amount, status, site, reference, bank, type, and scores. In addition, by default, if no filter is applied, the system displays the transactions generated on the current day and during the last hour.  

To view detailed information about a transaction, click on the information corresponding to the date of the record you wish to view.

![infoquery](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/infoquery.webp) 

When entering the desired record, all information corresponding to the transaction must be displayed, such as the transaction amount, status, and ID.

Enter values in the fields corresponding to the search criteria and then click on **Filter**. The transactions that meet the criteria entered in the filters should be displayed on the screen.  

## Criteria for using filters

## Options within a transaction query

A confirmation message will be displayed on the screen.

![notifiactiontrx](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/notifiactiontrx.webp) 

## Reverse transaction

The process of reversing a transaction consists of refunding an approved transaction. To reverse a transaction, click on the **Options** button in the transaction details.
This will display the available options, including **Reverse transaction**. Click on this option.

![reversetrx](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reversetrx.webp) 

A confirmation message should be displayed about the operation to be performed, with the options **Cancel** and **Reverse transaction**. Click on **Reverse transaction**.  

![confirmationreversetrx](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/confirmationreversetrx.webp) 

When a reversal is made, a new **Reversal** transaction is generated, so two transactions will be displayed: the original transaction, which becomes **Reversed**, and the new **Reversal** transaction that is generated. 

![reviewreverse](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reviewreverse.webp) 

<Note type="error"> This option is only available when the transaction has not yet reached the cut-off time for the country. Reverse transactions may be declined (i.e., the transaction will not be reversed) due to operational conditions, issuer validations, expired time windows, or other payment method restrictions. Always validate the status of the reversal before confirming to the end user that the money has been returned. </Note>

## Reverse letter

<CountryFlags countries="CO, EC"  prefix="Available for: " className='mt-4'/>

<Note type="error"> Only displayed after the cut-off times for each country. </Note>

To print the chargeback letter, click on the **Options** button in the transaction details. 
This will display the available options, including **Chargeback Letter**. Click on it.

![reverseletter](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reverseletter.webp) 

A reverse request letter must be generated in PDF format, which will be downloaded to your browser by default. 

![viewletter](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/viewletter.webp) 

Once the refund to the customer has been confirmed, we recommend marking the transaction as an untimely reversal so that when you obtain exports, the transaction is marked as reversed.

![overtimereverse](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/overtimereverse.webp) 

A confirmation message should be displayed about the operation to be performed, with the options **Cancel** and **Late Reversal**. Click on **Late Reversal**.  

![confirmoverreverse](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/confirmoverreverse.webp)

## Refund

<CountryFlags countries="PR, CR, PA, BZ, UY, HN"  prefix="Available for: " className='mt-4'/>

The process of refunding a transaction consists of issuing a refund for an approved transaction to the cardholder. To issue the refund, click on the **Options** button in the transaction details.
This will display the available options, including **Refund**. Click on this option.

![refundtrx](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/refundtrx.webp)

A confirmation message should appear regarding the operation to be performed, with the options **Cancel** and **Refund transaction**. Click on **Refund transaction**.

Two types of refunds can be made: **Total** and **Partial**.

![refundtype](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/refundtype.webp)

If we choose a full refund, the following image will appear, indicating the amount to be refunded.

![totalrefund](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/totalrefund.webp)

For partial refunds, we can enter the amount we want to refund to the user.

![partialrefund](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/partialrefund.webp)

When a refund is made, a new transaction of type **Refund** is generated, so two transactions will be displayed: the original transaction, which becomes **Refunded**, and the new transaction of type **Refund**.
Additionally, if we access the refunded transaction, we can view the status of the refund and the refund attempts that have been made.

![viewrefund](/en/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/viewrefund.webp)

Each partial refund generates a separate record and reduces the balance available for future refunds on the same original transaction.

<Note type="error"> Please note that any full or partial refund may be declined (i.e., the transaction will not be refunded) due to operational conditions, issuer validations, expired time windows, or other payment method restrictions. Always validate the refund status before confirming to the end user that the money has been returned. </Note>
