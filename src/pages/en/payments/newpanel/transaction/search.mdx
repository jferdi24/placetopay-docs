# Transactions module

The transactions module allows users to view and manage operations within the system securely and efficiently. Through this functionality, you can check the status of transactions and obtain detailed information.{{ className: 'lead' }}

## Transaction filters

The basic option filters in transactions are tools that allow users to limit, organize, and analyze information more efficiently within a system. Within the transactions option in Panel, there is a Filter option. When clicked, a screen will be displayed showing the following fields:

- **Save Filter:** Option that allows you to save a filter. 

- **My Filters:** Button where saved filters are stored. 

- **Select field:** Select the field by which you want to filter. 

- **Select operator:** Select the operator by which you want to perform the query.  

- **Value:** Field where you enter the value to search for in the filter. 

- **Delete button:** At the end of each search criterion, there is a button that allows you to delete the information entered.  

- **Add Filter:** Button that allows you to add a new row for search criteria. The fields select field, select operator, and value are added.

- **Remove Filters:** Button that removes the filters created and leaves only the default filters.

- **Clear:** Button that deletes all existing filters.

- **Filter:** Button that allows you to run the filters.

Enter values in the fields corresponding to the search criteria and then click on **Filter**. The transactions that meet the criteria entered in the filters should be displayed on the screen.  

## Criteria for using filters

To use filters correctly, the following criteria must be taken into account:

When using the Creation Date filter (the user selects a date range), it must be accompanied by at least one of the following filters and one of the permitted operators (Within, equal to, contains):

- **Site** 

- **Business** 

- **Airline** 

- **Franchise** 

- **Responsible user** 

- **Email** 

- **IP address** 

- **Payer ID** 

The filters that can be used alone as long as the operator is **the same** are: 

- **Card number**

- **Internal reference**

- **Authorization/CUS**

- **Administrative fee authorization**

- **Receipt**

- **ID**

- **Reference**

## Transaction query.

The Transaction Query allows users to view the history of operations performed in the system. Advanced filters, such as date, transaction type, and status, facilitate the search and analysis of specific records.

To start the query, you must enter the Transactions option. 

![consulta de transacciones](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/consultadetransacciones.webp) 

The Transactions, Recurring Transactions, and Transaction Statistics options should be displayed. 
There is a filter option and a table that allows you to view transactions with the following fields: date, amount, status, site, reference, bank, type, and scores. In addition, by default, if no filter is applied, the system displays the transactions generated on the current day and during the last hour.  

To view detailed information about a transaction, click on the information corresponding to the date of the record you wish to view.

## Reverse transaction

The process of reversing a transaction consists of refunding an approved transaction. To reverse a transaction, click on the **Options** button in the transaction details.
This will display the available options, including **Reverse transaction**. Click on this option.

![reversatrx](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reversatrx.webp) 

A confirmation message should be displayed about the operation to be performed, with the options **Cancel** and **Reverse transaction**. Click on **Reverse transaction**.  

![confirmacionreverso](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/confirmacionreverso.webp) 

When a reversal is made, a new **Reversal** transaction is generated, so two transactions will be displayed: the original transaction, which becomes **Reversed**, and the new **Reversal** transaction that is generated. 

![trxsreversos](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/trxsreversos.webp) 

<Note type="error"> This option is only available when the transaction has not yet reached the cut-off time for the country. Reverse transactions may be declined (i.e., the transaction will not be reversed) due to operational conditions, issuer validations, expired time windows, or other payment method restrictions. Always validate the status of the reversal before confirming to the end user that the money has been returned. </Note>

## Reverse letter

<CountryFlags countries="CO, EC"  prefix="Available for: " className='mt-4'/>

<Note type="error"> Only displayed after the cut-off times for each country. </Note>

To print the chargeback letter, click on the **Options** button in the transaction details. 
This will display the available options, including **Chargeback Letter**. Click on it.

![cartadereverso](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/cartadereverso.webp) 

A reverse request letter must be generated in PDF format, which will be downloaded to your browser by default. 

![cartareversppdf](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/cartareversppdf.webp) 

Once the refund to the customer has been confirmed, we recommend marking the transaction as an untimely reversal so that when you obtain exports, the transaction is marked as reversed.

![reversoextemporaneo](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reversoextemporaneo.webp) 

A confirmation message should be displayed about the operation to be performed, with the options **Cancel** and **Late Reversal**. Click on **Late Reversal**.

## Refund

<CountryFlags countries="PR, CR, PA, BZ, UY, HN"  prefix="Available for: " className='mt-4'/>

The process of refunding a transaction consists of issuing a refund for an approved transaction to the cardholder. To issue the refund, click on the **Options** button in the transaction details.

![reembolsartrx](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reembolsartrx.webp)

A confirmation message should appear regarding the operation to be performed, with the options **Cancel** and **Refund transaction**. Click on **Refund transaction**.

Two types of refunds can be made: **Total** and **Partial**.

![tiposdereembolso](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/tiposdereembolso.webp)

If we choose a full refund, the following image will appear, indicating the amount to be refunded.

![reembolsototal](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reembolsototal.webp)

For partial refunds, we can enter the amount we want to refund to the user.

![reembolsoparcial](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/reembolsoparcial.webp)

When a refund is made, a new transaction of type **Refund** is generated, so two transactions will be displayed: the original transaction, which becomes **Refunded**, and the new transaction of type **Refund**.
Additionally, if we access the refunded transaction, we can view the status of the refund and the refund attempts that have been made.

![trxreembolsada](/payments/newpanel/migration/transaction/trxreembolsada.webp)

Each partial refund generates a separate record and reduces the balance available for future refunds on the same original transaction.

<Note type="error"> Ten en cuenta que cualquier reembolso total o parcial puede resultar declinado (es decir, no se realizara el reembolso de la transacción) por condiciones operativas, validaciones del emisor, ventanas de tiempo vencidas u otras restricciones del medio de pago. Siempre valida el estado del reembolso antes de confirmar al usuario final que el dinero fue devuelto. </Note>
