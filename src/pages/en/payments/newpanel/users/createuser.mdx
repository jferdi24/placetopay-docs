## Two-factor authentication

Below is the information corresponding to two-factor authentication, which must be completed in order to access the Panel, by following these steps:

- Download one of the applications suggested in step 1 (Validate the following image)

- Scan the QR code with the downloaded application. 

- Finally, enter the code generated in the app after scanning the barcode.

- Click the **Authenticate** button to complete the process.

This process is described in detail in the system interface:

Once two-factor authentication has been successfully verified, the recovery codes that can be used in case you are unable to successfully perform two-factor authentication using the authentication apps should be displayed on the screen.  

There is a **Download** button, which allows you to download the codes. It is recommended that you save them in a safe place so that they can be used if necessary.
