# Dash
The following documentation aims to illustrate the steps necessary to migrate user accounts from the Panel system to the new version of the system, hereinafter referred to as the Dash.  {{ className: 'lead' }}

1. Start by accessing the corresponding URL for the Dash, where the login interface will be displayed with the email and password fields, as well as the Login button and the option to reset your password.
