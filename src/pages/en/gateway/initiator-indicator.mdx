# Transaction Initiator Indicator

For Mastercard transactions, to comply with the Data Integrity Control Program for Cardholder-Initiated and Merchant-Initiated Transaction Indicators, an indicator is sent to the network. The application will calculate this indicator automatically, but if a specific value is needed, it can be sent as an additional value.
