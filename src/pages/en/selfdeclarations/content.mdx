## General:
In this module, you will find relevant information for any software user. It explains the application's features, such as changing the language, providing help or alert messages, and troubleshooting.

## Administrator:
Administrators are the users who can configure the system modules, create users, grant permissions, and generally manage the application. This manual provides all the information that will help administrators use the tool, create new users, determine tax return parameters, and more. It also explains the system's basic features.

## Auditor:
The auditor is the user responsible for reviewing and supervising the information within the system. Although they access the system through the same link as the administrator user, their permissions are restricted exclusively to reading and viewing. Their main function is to ensure control and monitoring of the information without intervening in its modification. To create a user with the auditor role, the system administrator must configure the corresponding permissions. To learn how to configure this role, click here : [Role Configuration.](/selfdeclarations/admin-user/actions#security)

## Declarant:
The declarant is one of the most important roles in the system, as they are the user who creates, authorizes, declares, and pays taxes. All the functions and relevant information are explained here so that taxpayers can correctly manage and understand how the application works.
